# My 1st Project - Weather App 🌤️

A simple weather app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
It fetches live weather data using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

## Features
Search for weather by city
Display temperature, humidity, and wind speed
Show the current time, date, and day of the selected city
Display the current weather condition using an appropriate weather icon (e.g., cloud, clear, rain)

### How to Run
Just Open `weather.html` in a browser.

#### Future Plans
Make the layout responsive for different devices
Improve the accuracy of the weather images to match current conditions more closely
Clean up and organize the code for better readability
